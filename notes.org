* Tasks
** Need to convert values from rns to int (only for tests).
** DONE consistent naming for "ring_dim", "poly_len", "n"
** TODO Try multiplication
*** multiplication is very complex task:
- [x] renialization
- [ ] rescale
** TODO Implement key switching
*** How to generate "switching key"
*** gadget decomposition (?) for ciphertext
** TODO Implement bootstraping
** TODO Need to make RNS system (which could be complex)


* Glossary
** *ideal*
a subset of a ring with special properties:
- It’s closed under addition.
- Multiplying any element of the ideal by any element from the original ring remains inside the ideal.
** *quotient ring*
also known as factor ring, difference ring or residue class ring
constructed by taking a ring and “modding out” by an ideal, resulting in a simplified ring structure where elements of that ideal become zero.

Original ring: `{Z}[X]`, polynomials with integer coefficients.
Ideal: (X^4 + 1), generated by polynomial X^4 + 1.

Quotient ring: `{Z}[X]/(X^4 + 1)`

means any polynomial divisible by `X^4 + 1` is effectively zero.
Thus, polynomial multiplication must be simplified modulo `X^4 + 1`:

- Set X^4 = -1, thus:
- X^5 = X * X^4 = X * (-1) = -X
- X^6 = X^2 * X^4 = X^2 * (-1) = -X^2, and so forth.
